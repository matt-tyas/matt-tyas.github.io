### Beautiful Interface





The careers service required a simple application to allow students to search and contact former Leeds University students in order to get advice on their chosen careers.





#### Processes





I began by producing low fidelity wireframes and user flows of the application on paper and in Omnigraffle as the requirements were fairly simple. I then put polish on the UI in Photoshop.





#### Technical





I built the application in .NET using HTML5, CSS and Jquery.
