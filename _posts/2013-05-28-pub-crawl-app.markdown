### Day long project




My 30th birthday pub crawl application was a day long project. I decided it would be a fun way to guide my friends around the pub crawl route and provide them with a way to track the pubs they had visited.




#### Technical




The application uses HTML 5 local storage through javascript to save the users progress through the crawl route.
