So, about 10 minutes ago I got a text from my good friend John Dowswell (known to me, since childhood as Doog). It seems the art work he produces across Sheffield has been making a bit of an impact and has just been featured on the [BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-16078742). 

[![Street Art by John Dowswell Sheffield](http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/doog-art.jpg)](http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/doog-art.jpg)

Doog paints ducks on pubs and leaves socks that look like cheese in the supermarket all of which is okay by me. [Check the gallery here for a better explanation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-16078742). 

Good work matey!
