**It makes perfect sense for me to have a smart watch. **

I love tech, I love shiny new toys and hate having to put my hand _all the way_ _into my pocket _then _adjust my bag _or_ look where I'm going _whilst I read a text or see if my hilarious Facebook comments have had any likes. So a watch that could summaries that information for me would be a very useful extension to my online world.


## But I don't want one


Well, I do. Obviously. But I don't. And here's why. I really like watches. I like what they stand for. They remind me just how fast the pace of technology is moving by remaining constant. A consistently useful (classically single function) item that for a very long time (well, a long time in the tech world) was the only affordable personal computer (sort of - I'm not sure a watch counts as a computer but you can see where I'm going with this) that most normal people could afford and most did, own.


## It feels too throwaway


Technology needs replacing and updating every few years and I don't think I'm ready to accept that fact about my wrist wear. I currently wear a 1970s Omega that keeps better time than any other analogue clock I've ever owned and _it's way older than me. _

If I buy an Apple iWatch I'll have to get a new one in a year or two or it will make me sad to look at the faded glory of its Stone Age processing power and the fact it can't beam Star Wars style holograms of You Tube 'fails' on to my mate's coffee table like the new model.


## Is it a Mini Disk?


My second feeling about this new line of wearable tech is that it is a stepping stone to something better. Not that I think it will disappear after a few years like a mini or laser disk as I'm sure it will be an acceptable way for many to make their data connection more portable but for me, I'd want to be more integrated. Honestly, I'm holding out for a Google glass contact lense, an Apple iTattoo or something that starts to take us to the Sci-Fi realm of the Cyborg. _A_n interesting aside here is that having dental fillings actually already makes us Cyborgs as a Cyborg is defined as: _A cyborg is a human being, changed to improve or restore body functions by the addition or replacement of man-made parts. _So for me I have very few hang ups about going down this path when it becomes available, but that sounds like a blog post in itself.


## So for nowâ€¦


I will never have these kind of hang ups about my trusty old analogue friend, or, maybe I'm getting old and grumpy...
