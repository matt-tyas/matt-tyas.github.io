### Web Solutions portfolio site




I recently re-designed and built our Web Solutions team website at the University of Leeds. We wanted something friendly that was a portfolio but also an approachable point of contact. I went for a fairly standard style of portfolio design focusing on a good solid layout and typography. Currently the site is static however the mark-up will be the basis for the templates used when we move the site over to our CMS, Jadu. The site is fully responsive. The navigation and links respond to become more usable on mobile or tablet and the also the slider ([Flexslider](http://flex.madebymufffin.com/)) can be swiped left of right or has larger buttons for navigating at smaller resolutions.
