### A web application to track your progress through university





Leeds for Life is a hugely successful tool that I helped to redesign whilst at Leeds. We conducted user research, focus groups and I created a fully working prototype of the system to test with users before any design was done. The finished product allows students to book tutorials and dialogue about them with their tutor, grades and module marks are automatically recorded to their timeline, as well as any other achievements they wish to record (such as work experience) in order to use this information to build a CV when they graduate.





#### Technical





The latest HTML 5 and CSS 3 with jQuery and build on .NET
