### Safelyback





Safelyback was a web application I designed and built whilst working for Clearview Media. Safelyback was a unique online service developed with customersâ€™ safety in mind. The user would simply use the application to let it know they were home after going out. Initially targeted at young women, the service was later focused on shift workers and those travelling to remote locations.






#### Technical





The app was built on Rudy on Rails as a standalone mobile website.
