### 'Human' Resources





I wanted to create a HR site for Leeds University that made searching for information quick and easy for users.





#### Processes





I found through the requirements gathering that users would come to the HR website with a single query. I decided therefore that much like the [original iteration of the .gov website](http://alpha.gov.uk/) we would try to use search as the main means of site navigation targeting common searches from the old site such as, 'how much tax should I pay?'. I was responsible for the final visual design of the site. I kept it very clean, with an emphasis on typography and friendliness.





#### Technical





I designed a search that would pull results back instantly in a page overlay meaning results could be searched, reviewed (re-searched if necessary) and actioned without leaving the homepage.
