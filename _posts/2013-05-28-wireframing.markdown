### Wireframes





Although I prefer to produce wireframes in HTML, CSS and Javascript to give users a closer impression of the final product (and to make iterations of functionality faster) I have in the past also produced paper prototypes to present to clients. The separation of design from function is an important one in the early stages of development as it helps a client or user focus on the objective of the application.





These wireframes relate to the [Volunteering application](http://matthewtyas.com/volunteering/) I design and built for the University of Leeds.





#### Technical





I tend to use Omnigraffle to create wireframes.
