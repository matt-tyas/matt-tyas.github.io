[The Terrapimp on Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/nannybanton/terrapimp).

These are not exactly supposed to be my finest design work, but they are loads of fun to do and pay homage to the bad hip hop album covers of the 90's (think Master P, No Limit Records). Loads of gold, diamonds, money and zoo animals. Chuck in as many Photoshop effects as you can (pile on the layer styles) and you've got covers nearly as good as some of these classics - see the [100 worst Hip Hop covers of all time](http://www.buzzfeed.com/melismashable/the-100-worst-hip-hop-album-covers-of-all-time).
