### Infographic





More of a story maybe than an inforgraphic, 'The Five Principles of Service Design Thinking', is a graphic I created to accompany the [Global Service jam](http://planet.globalservicejam.org/) to help to explain to less experienced attendees the main ideas behind designing for a service.





These principles are insights from renowned Service Designer [@MrStickdorn](https://twitter.com/MrStickdorn)'s book, '[This is Service Design Thinking](http://www.tisdt.com/)'.
