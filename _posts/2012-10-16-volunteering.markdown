### Overview



The volunteering database at Leeds University was designed to give students a central area to find opportunities to boost their CV and skills which feed into their course progress and career prospects. I used a free text search as the main focus as it was clear from talking to students and stakeholders that most users would come to the site with a clear idea of the type of placement they would wish to pursue. The latest opportunities are shown with either, 'closing date', or, 'places remaining' flagged as popular placements filled up fast. This also kept the site feeling fresh and updated regularly.



#### Processes


I wanted the site to highlight the individuals whose contributions mean so much to those they help. I had to work with the dark colours and pink of another University site [Leeds for life](https://leedsforlife.leeds.ac.uk) therefore I decided to create a town where the pink characters added colour to the grey scene by helping the local community. I also decided to pull out Volunteer stories that might inspire others to get involved in the footer with a Coda style slider.



#### Technical


Built on .NET with HTML 5, CSS 3 using various Jquery plugins including [plax](https://github.com/cameronmcefee/plax) by [Cameron Mcefee](http://www.cameronmcefee.com/), which creates the 3D effect of the header and an Icon font accessibly implemented.
