As a Web Designer, I am often focussed on just that. The Web. The website, the application, the user journey or even the tiniest molecule of UI such as a button or an animation. [The SDT Conference](http://www.sdt2013.org/) for me was a lesson in the bigger picture. I’m used to creating one touch point in a whole thread of user interactions with an organisation – designing and building that part to the best of my ability. Over the course of the weekend however, I was able to understand more fully how all the parts (pre-service, service and post-service) connect in a meaningful way for the customer to create one overarching and hopefully positive experience.

Thursday’s workshop from [Markus Hormess](https://twitter.com/markusedgar) and [Marc Stickdorn](https://twitter.com/MrStickdorn) taught us to identify trends and gaps in markets asking us to create services that sought to fill these gaps. We had short timescales in which to rapidly prototype ideas focussing on iteration. We ended up with an app idea, but more importantly than the design or experience of this app, we had been forced to contemplate the, ‘how’ and the ‘why’ of it, placing its existence and usage into a wider context.

On Friday [Adam StJohn Lawrence](https://twitter.com/adamstjohn) used persona mapping and role play to show us how to apply dramatic structure to every customer interaction with a company to create the perfect emotional journey. This allowed me to begin to understand how my piece of the puzzle might fit into this dramatic arc on a grander scale.

This experience reiterated to me that I must frame my own thumbnail of work everyday inside, the bigger picture.
