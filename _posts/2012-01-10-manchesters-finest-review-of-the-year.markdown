I have realised that in 21 days [Manchester's Finest](http://www.manchesterfinest.com) will have been live for a year.

The site is running well, thanks to [Lee Isherwood](http://www.tilecreative.com) (he has done an incredible amount of promotion, and general work) and we have had some excellent contributors come on board to give their journalistic talents for little or no reward. It really has been an exciting side project to be a part of and nice to build a high traffic site that I did not hand off to a client and never see again.

It is safe to say I think that we have a solid user base, around 12,000 hits a month with peaks of up to 16,000 and, as we approach our first year live, it is time to look forward to how I hope to improve the site over the next year.


## The Year Ahead


Less Plugins, Leaner Mark-up.

In the next year I hope to reduce the site's reliance on plugin's and clean up the code. This is such a short sentence, but such a huge job. When I developed the site there were areas I could not develop alone without the aid of plugins. With the knowledge I have acquired over the last year it may now be possible to remove some of the plugins that I feel we could do without and hopefully improve the front-end mark-up to improve performance within the site.


## A Mobile Strategy


I kick myself daily about not building in mobile support from the start. This has to be tackled. Finest's strength is it's ability to give people fresh ideas about where to go, what to see, and what to do in Manchester. As you can see from the [mobile app I designed a while ago](http://matthewtyas.com/manchesters-finest-mobile-app/) a mobile version of the site (or a responsive version, as I would have gone with originally) would give users the flexibility to use the site on the go on small devices.


## This is an opportunity


If I can't easily build responsive features in to the site now then maybe we do look at something like the App mentioned above. We can then give users something the site does not - the ability to select what they want (eating, drinking, shops etc) while on the go in Manchester then be served reviews, directions and whatever other meta data we can pull from our database that we think is useful. The amount of times I have been in a city wanting to know where the cool places to go are, not just the chains that fill city centres.

It's certainly a lot to think about, and I need to make friends with an App developer, any takers?
