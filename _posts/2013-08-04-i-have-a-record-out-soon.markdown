No blog posts for a while I know. A lot has been going on with Finest and also my music production, which has resulted me getting a beat on a record that should be out very soon. The track, 'Elephant's Breath', features legendary New York rapper [Sadat X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadat_X) and Manchester's own [Burgundy Blood](http://www.youtube.com/user/killmoneytube?feature=watch). I'm pretty proud of it so [grab a pre-order here](http://heavycrates.com/product/burgundy-blood-feat-sadat-x-king-cesar-darc-mind/).

If you want to give it a listen check it out.
