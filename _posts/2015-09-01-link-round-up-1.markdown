Most people in this industry suffer from information overload and I, am no different. How can we find the time to actually asses the range of new frameworks, techniques and interesting blog titles that invade every feed, on every screen we own on a minute by minute basis? Well, here's my solutionâ€¦
I'm going to pick the top few (I reserve to the right for this to 1, 3 or 10) at any given time and share them. Just the top five from the first page of emails I've sent myself. That way, some of them will get my (and hopefully your) attention.


## 1. Don't Fear the Internet


My colleagues at Co-op often ask my team and I, "What is all that coloured writing on your computer screen - a secret language that only you can know about because it will keep you and your descendants in work forever if you don't tell the rest of us about it?" No, I reply making a promise I can't possibly hope to keep that I will one day teach you of the wonders of the DOM, CSS animations, and my hatred of anything that is not open source. But until that glorious day when I actually find time to teach the world (my colleagues at Co-op) to code, here is a lovely site aimed and keen amateurs that teaches basic HTML and CSS with hanady and brilliantly designed videos by Jessica Herche & Russ Maschmeyer (who are both great and worth a follow).

## 2. Flinto


I've been looking for a possible InVision replacement that would allow our UX Designers to start to design the interactions on websites and Apps more easily. Flinto looks like a candidate, but what is it really offering that Adobe Edge isn't? I think we need to give these products a whirl.

## 3. A lovely interaction


I am a firm believer in delight and fun on the web. Yes, be functional. Please, help your user. But, why not make them happy by making something work really well. By making it feel lovely to use? Elliot Condon does a lovely job of that on his personal site that I stubbled across this week. I use timelines a lot on this site for representing project progress and I love the way he uses CSS wizardry to fill the timeline as you scroll and changes the colour based on the type of content you are scrolling past. Serious skillz.

## 4. ASDA launch a new site


Last week The Drum. Alerted me to the new ASDA website, which has taken an uncluttered 'key action' approach to it's new website. The site for the most part seeks to act as a front door to the rest of the brand's e-commerce estate and possibly has a touch of the Google Material Design about it. Whatever you think the way it is put together is clean and seems to focus on funnelling cutomers to key areas of the site. I think the uncluttered negative space approach will serve them well as iteration moving forward will be fairly simple to implement.

That's all for now everyone.
