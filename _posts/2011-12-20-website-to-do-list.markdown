I may as well store this here. It makes sense to publicly shame myself into getting these jobs done as soon as possible.


## Fixing the responsiveness of the site





	
  * The main navigation at present need to be tweaked for smaller screens

	
  * Test the responsiveness of the images within the site currently

	
  * Overflow problems leading to the layout looking jumbled

	
  * A good majority of the pages elements scale well however




## Browser Support


Currently the site is only supporting IE down to version 9, I should at least go to 8, which would in turn fix most issues on IE 7 anyway as far as I can tell.


## Go Live Critical Content


I may pull the, 'About' and, 'Services' for go live. As there is a small, 'About' section in the footer and I do not see Services as critical material at this stage.


## Minimum Requirements


For the site to go live I would like it to be responsive, and have some portfolio pieces in the work section at the very least. I feel the rest of these jobs can, for the time being wait.
