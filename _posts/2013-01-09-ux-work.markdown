### Recent prototyping





Currently I am doing the UX work on a large web application for students at Leeds. The application will need to adapt to and size whilst also allowing the user to complete a wide range of tasks easily such as filling in forms or making bookings.





#### Processes





After digesting the client requirements I met with with key users to integrated their ideas into some initial sketches. These were then refined over a period of time with the client, users and with the feedback of my team. I then started to build a static HTML prototype to show user journeys through workflows and the basic user interaction. This was again refined by meeting various users and the clients.





#### Technical





I used a HTML and CSS preprocessor ([hammer](http://hammerformac.com/)) using SASS so I could quickly create a prototype that helped the clients understand how the app will work on different devices and how they will interact with the system to complete tasks.
