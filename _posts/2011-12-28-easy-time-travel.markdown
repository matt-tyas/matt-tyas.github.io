Found at the back of Katie's Mum's cupboard one unopened Tesco can opener circa 1986. Trapped in time, unopened products from the past really do have a eerie quality to them and are the an easy and fun way to feel like you've travelled back in time. The grid background (like this is a can opener from Tron) lazer style type face with and the fact that the rather mundane can opener is called, 'Lift Off', just oozes 80's optimism.
