## A quick thought...


Block ads, block fonts, block just about anything. After the release of IOS 9 user's voices have been heard with the huge amount of downloads of content blockers from Apple's App Store.

The answer dear readers? Good old progressive enhancement. If you build with standards and layer up functionality then users can still consume your content no matter what.

Mind you, it might be harder to make money.
