A Christmas themed blog on the 9th of January does seem a bit odd. In the same way, as, straight after boxing day I don't like the Christmas tree anymore. All the shine has gone, the lights don't seem as bright and I feel a bit dirty after all the festive cheer I've exuded.

That however, is a long way from the point. The point is, back in October I decided to make a themed Christmas card for friends and family.


## This years (last years) theme - 50's

I think it might become a yearly thing.
