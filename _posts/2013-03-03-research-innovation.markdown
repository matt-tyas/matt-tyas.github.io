### Concept design




As part of the Leeds digital web strategy I have been tasked with redesigning major areas of the university's public facing websites. The end goal with this work is produce a shared visual language library (similar to the [BBC's Gel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel)) that can span across all Leeds websites and applications to give a stronger brand image whilst retaining the ability to produce design that is tailored to the correct audience.
