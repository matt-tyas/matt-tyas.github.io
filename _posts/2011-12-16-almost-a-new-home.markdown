My new site, at the time of writing this (although still in development) is all but complete. I am fairly happy and I think I will find the time to log my processes properly after I put it live and I've got a bit of work uploaded. I will however use these preliminary pre-live posts as a means to style the blog further so I need some real content. Something I can get someone to sit down and read to make sure and the design elements are tied up, everything is styled and the blog has good readability and rhythm.



## Embarrassing Websiteâ€¦



I decided to create a new site the day I released I had become embarrassed to give out my [old URL](http://www.cmdcreative.com) anymore, not a good sign I agree. The site was tired design wise, not built with a modern approach and built on a CMS that did not do well, what I wanted it too. That coupled with the fact that the domain name had become free a while back and I had snapped it up with the intention of putting something new up anyway.

It has however been a very busy year what with starting a new job at [Leeds University](http://www.leeds.ac.uk) and launching my most ambitious side-project to date [manchestersfinest.com](http://www.manchestersfinest.com). Time to finally get down to work on this site never seemed like it was going to come, however in early November I simply couldn't stand it anymore and put a [holding page up](http://www.matthewtyas.com). Before long I had a Wordpress install in my dev folder and before you know it I was actually get my hands dirty coding up my matt-tyas theme. So I have got the thing to nearly a finished point in about a month. When I say finished though the term is relatively loose. I have a long list of work still to do. What I have achieved thus far however.



## Creating the site structure



I created pages for, 'Home', 'About', 'Services' and, 'contact'. Home is then set as the homepage and uses a custom template that pulls in the newest four portfolio pieces, an area with information on Mcrfinest and an area that pulls in the newest two blog posts. I only have one category for the blog, called, 'blog', to categorise within the blog I will either simply use tags or, sub-categories of, 'blog'. I am yet to decide this. For my portfolio I created a, 'Work' category and subcategories to sit under it. The work category page is displayed using a custom category template and the sub categories are then sorted using some Jquery (filterable.js) which I extended slightly so my sub-category titles would change when the categories are sorted. It looks sweet, check it out.



## Mobile in Mind



My new web design term, just made it up. Although I'm doubtful it will catch on. Why? Well rather than design for mobile first and work up to the larger screen resolutions ([as you are supposed to - see 320 and up here](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/)) I decided as I was well aware of exactly what my content was and how I wanted it to be displayed I design and built this site with, 'mobile in mind'. I also assumed there would be time constraints due to other work therefore I wanted a desktop site live first. Having a responsive site is very important to me but because of the time I have put into building the site in the first place the layout actually only needs some tweaks get it ready thanks to my skills (lulz) and thanks to the [Bones Wordpress developer theme](http://themble.com/bones/) I chose to lay the foundations of my code (that is for another in depth blog, as are the responsive design elements of the site really). Anyway my decision to go this route will be tested in the coming weeks so let's see if I made a mistake or not!



## Plenty left to do



I still do have a lot to do then. The site is only tested fully in Webkit and Firefox and needs mobile tweaks. I am not fully happy with the design of the inner pages (I am designing this in the browser as well, once again - another blog) and I need to come up with content for the, 'About', 'Services' and populate the, 'Work' section. It's all fun though.

It is however my birthday today so you will forgive me if I cut this short now. 

Bye.
