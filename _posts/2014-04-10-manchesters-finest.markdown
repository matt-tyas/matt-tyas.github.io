### Showcasing the best Manchester has to offer





Manchesterâ€™s Finest is a blog I co-own, design, build, maintain, write for, and run with long time collaborator and friend Lee Isherwood. We started the site in 2010 to fill a gap we identified for a site that promoted the best independents in Manchester. The site has been a big success. We get 30,000 plus visitors a month, and have a weekly newsletter and twitter account with over 10,000 subscribers each. We look to constantly review, improve and promote the site. Over the last six months I have improved the coding, introduced a mobile view and automated the sending of the 
newsletter, as well as focusing on new user groups (such as the student population) and recruited new young writers to keep our content fresh and relevant.





#### Focus on simplicity





Since launch the site has only had minor tweaks to the layout (mainly to free up some advertising space in the header) and to try give better prominence and more control over some of the content on the homepage. The idea was that the simpler the better would be the best approach and this has paid off.





#### Technical





Finest has good old Wordpress handling the backend and a quite a few plugins (many that I have customised) to add functionality.
