A new track I came up with over Easter sampling some prog rock, with some guitars provided by musical genius [Bredsnak](http://soundcloud.com/bredsnak). Produced using the Akai MPK and Ableton.



It's a bit weird, I was going for an [El-P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El-P) style beat with a bit of [Four Tet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Hebden) thrown in. Anyway you be the judge.
