Before Christmas I was asked to create a sliding contact form for the [Leeds for Life](https://leedsforlife.leeds.ac.uk) site here at the University. I think it came out pretty well so I thought I'd share. I added a few extra touches such as the background opacity to focus users attention on the form and also the opening and closing envelope on the tab. As I always say, it's all about the little touches!

[View the finished form here](http://matthewtyas.com/lab/sliding-contact-form/).

[Or, if I delete the example ever, here on JsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/matt_tyas/y3e6N/16/).
