A quick post of my most recent experiments on JS Fiddle using HTML, CSS and Jquery.  After the amount of traffic my [Jquery sliding contact form](http://matthewtyas.com/sliding-jquery-contact-form/) had I decided to share a bit more of this stuff. It's not like most of these techniques are unique (they're kind of like the [fake versions of big brand chocolate bars they sell at Aldi](http://www.somethingnew365.com/aldi-fake-mars-bar-142365)), but I like to try to write solutions to these myself rather than relying on other code I may not fully understand.

**Most of these have, or hopefully will soon find their way into production sites some time soon.**



## Fade out element after certain scroll height and fix to the top of the browser (stupid titleâ€¦)



I colleague of mine needed to fix the navigation of a site to the top of the browser after  the height of the masthead had been scrolled past. The nav then needed to fade back slightly but return to full opacity on hover. There was to be no opacity changes on hover  hover when the masthead was shown on screen.

_Note: This may have a slight issue in IE8 still and I has not really been thought through fully in terms of touch devices._



## BBC style slide out navigation menu



Exactly what it says on the tin. I figured this was bound to come in handy at some point.

This experiment lead me on to try to replicate the Facebook app left hand slide out menu.

Coming soon to the Manchesters Finest responsive Wordpress plugin.

That is all worth mentioning for now but there is plenty more at [http://jsfiddle.net/user/matt_tyas/fiddles/](http://jsfiddle.net/user/matt_tyas/fiddles/)

_Note: I know all the cool kids use [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/) but my little experiments are less of a showcase and more of the day to day issues I try to solve when dealing with my personal projects._
