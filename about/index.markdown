# Matt Tyas — UX Designer and Front-end Developer


Originally from [Hebden Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebden_Bridge). I live in Manchester and am the UX Manager at the [Co-Operative](http://www.co-operative.coop).

I've been in the web industry a while and I feel comfortable taking on a number of roles. I'm happy tapping out code, designing, creating user journeys and wireframes and speaking to clients. I even present and give talks from time to time.

I'm a nice bloke who gets on with people. I would never claim to be the best at anything, I'll take advice where I need too but I'm also capable of plugging away on my own and putting my opinions forward. By that I mean I can be a bit of a show off…

In between my day job, running [Manchester's Finest](http://www.manchestersfinest.com/) and freelance work, you might bump into me at a [conference](http://lanyrd.com/profile/matttyas/) or hear my questions being answered on [web design podcasts](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/042-rapidfire-11/). I am also a mentor for students at [MMU](http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/), occasional [music maker](https://soundcloud.com/matt_tyas) (I produce for the small independent label [heavy crates](http://www.heavycrates.com)), [tweeter](https://twitter.com/MattTyas) and even more occasional [blog writer](http://matthewtyas.com/out-of-my-head).

Download my CV for the nitty gritty, check out my portfolio for the visual stuff and of course check out [manchestersfinest.com](http://www.manchestersfinest.com).
